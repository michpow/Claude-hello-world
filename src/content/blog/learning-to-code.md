# why I'm learning to code

There's something magical about being able to build things with code. You start with a blank screen and end up with something real — something people can use.

## My motivation

I've always been curious about how websites and apps work. One day I decided to stop wondering and start building.

## The tools I chose

After some research, I decided to learn:

1. **JavaScript/TypeScript** — the language of the web
2. **React + Next.js** — the most popular framework for building modern websites
3. **Tailwind CSS** — for making things look great without writing tons of CSS

## Building this portfolio

This portfolio website is actually my first real project! It's built with all the technologies I listed above. I'm learning by doing, and every page you see here is something I coded myself.

## Advice for other beginners

If you're thinking about learning to code, my advice is: **just start**. Don't wait until you feel ready. Pick a project, pick a tutorial, and start building. You'll learn so much faster by doing than by just reading.
