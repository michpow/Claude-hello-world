# Hello World!

Welcome to my very first blog post. I'm Michelle, and I'm learning to code!

## Why I started this blog

I wanted a place to document my learning journey. Writing about what I'm learning helps me understand it better, and hopefully it can help someone else too.

## What I'm learning

Right now I'm focused on:

- **React** — building user interfaces with components
- **Next.js** — a framework that makes React even more powerful
- **TypeScript** — adding types to JavaScript for fewer bugs
- **Tailwind CSS** — styling websites quickly with utility classes

## What's next

I'll be posting regularly about what I'm building and what I'm learning. Stay tuned!
