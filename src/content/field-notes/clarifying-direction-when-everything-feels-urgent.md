excerpt: "Most teams don't need more execution. They need fewer, clearer decisions they can trust."

## Context

A product team was moving quickly, with multiple stakeholders pushing for parallel work.

## Tension

Speed mattered, but alignment was fraying. Everyone felt busy, but clarity was slipping.

## What I Learned

Most teams don't need more execution. They need fewer, clearer decisions they can trust.
